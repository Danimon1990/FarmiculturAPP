# Phase 1 Implementation Guide 🌱

## ✅ Completed

### 1. **New Data Models Created** (`Models.swift`)

All new models have been created with a clean, hierarchical structure:

```
Farm
└── CropArea (Greenhouse, High Tunnel, etc.)
    └── Section (Section A, North Wing, etc.)
        └── Bed (PRIMARY WORKING UNIT)
            ├── StatusChange (History tracking)
            ├── PlantVariety (Can be multiple)
            └── HarvestReport (Worker entries)
```

**Key Models:**
- ✅ `Farm` - Top-level organization
- ✅ `CropArea` - Growing areas (greenhouse, high tunnel, outdoor, seedhouse, tree crops)
- ✅ `Section` - Sections within areas
- ✅ `Bed` - **Primary working unit** with full lifecycle tracking
- ✅ `BedStatus` - Lifecycle states (dirty → clean → prepared → planted → growing → harvesting → completed)
- ✅ `StatusChange` - Track every status change with timestamp
- ✅ `StartMethod` - Direct seed vs transplanted
- ✅ `PlantVariety` - Multiple varieties per bed
- ✅ `HarvestReport` - Worker harvest entries
- ✅ `HarvestUnit` - Plants, kg, lbs, bunches, boxes, trays, pieces
- ✅ `HarvestQuality` - Excellence rating system
- ✅ `CompletedBed` - Archive when harvest finished
- ✅ `FarmUser` - User/worker management
- ✅ `BedTask` - Task system for beds

### 2. **Firebase Service Created** (`FarmDataService.swift`)

Complete CRUD operations for all models:
- ✅ Authentication (sign in, sign up, sign out)
- ✅ Farm operations
- ✅ Crop area operations
- ✅ Section operations
- ✅ **Bed operations** (create, read, update, delete)
- ✅ Harvest report tracking
- ✅ Bed archival system
- ✅ Task management
- ✅ Firestore encoder/decoder integration

### 3. **Local Data Manager Created** (`LocalDataManager.swift`)

Offline support for all data:
- ✅ Generic save/load system
- ✅ JSON storage in documents directory
- ✅ Separate storage per entity type
- ✅ User preferences (current farm, last sync date)
- ✅ Clear all data utility

### 4. **Backup Created**
- ✅ Old models backed up to `Crop_OLD_BACKUP.swift`

---

## 📋 Next Steps - You Need To Do These

### Step 1: Add Files to Xcode Project ⚠️ IMPORTANT

The new files exist but aren't in the Xcode project yet. You need to add them:

1. Open Xcode
2. Right-click on the `FarmiculturAPP` folder in the Project Navigator
3. Select "Add Files to FarmiculturAPP..."
4. Select these files:
   - ✅ `Models.swift`
   - ✅ `FarmDataService.swift`
   - ✅ `LocalDataManager.swift`
5. Make sure "Copy items if needed" is **UNCHECKED** (files already exist)
6. Make sure "Add to targets: FarmiculturAPP" is **CHECKED**
7. Click "Add"

### Step 2: Update App Entry Point

Update `FarmiculturAPPApp.swift` to use the new service:

```swift
import SwiftUI
import Firebase

@main
struct FarmiculturAPPApp: App {
    @StateObject private var farmDataService = FarmDataService.shared
    
    init() {
        FirebaseApp.configure()
    }

    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            if farmDataService.isAuthenticated {
                MainAppView()  // We'll create this
                    .environmentObject(farmDataService)
            } else {
                AuthView()
                    .environmentObject(farmDataService)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Test in Firebase Console

1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Navigate to Firestore Database
3. You should see this structure after using the app:

```
/farms/{farmId}
  /cropAreas/{areaId}
    /sections/{sectionId}
      /beds/{bedId}
  /harvestReports/{reportId}
  /completedBeds/{completedBedId}
  /tasks/{taskId}
/users/{userId}
```

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Bed Lifecycle with Full Tracking

```swift
// Example: Creating and tracking a bed
var bed = Bed(
    sectionId: "section-123",
    cropAreaId: "greenhouse-1",
    bedNumber: "A1",
    status: .dirty
)

// Status changes are tracked
bed.addStatusChange(to: .clean, by: "John", notes: "Cleaned and ready")
bed.addStatusChange(to: .prepared, by: "John", notes: "Soil amended")

// Plant the bed
bed.startMethod = .transplanted
bed.datePlanted = Date()
bed.varieties = [
    PlantVariety(name: "Cherry Tomatoes", count: 24, daysToMaturity: 65, continuousHarvest: true)
]
bed.totalPlantCount = 24
bed.expectedHarvestStart = Calendar.current.date(byAdding: .day, value: 65, to: Date())
bed.isMultipleHarvest = true
bed.addStatusChange(to: .planted, by: "John")

// Workers report harvest
let report = HarvestReport(
    bedId: bed.id,
    reportedBy: "Maria",
    quantity: 5.5,
    unit: .kilograms,
    quality: .excellent,
    notes: "Beautiful tomatoes, excellent color",
    varieties: ["Cherry Tomatoes"]
)
bed.addHarvestReport(report)
```

### Archive When Complete

```swift
// When harvest is finished
let completedBed = CompletedBed(
    from: bed,
    archivedBy: "John",
    finalNotes: "Great season, high yield"
)

// This captures:
// - Full bed snapshot
// - Total harvest (5.5kg)
// - Number of reports (1)
// - Duration (days from plant to harvest)
// - Average yield per day
// - Season year
```

## 🔥 Firebase Firestore Structure

### Collections Layout

```
farms/
  {farmId}/
    name: "My Farm"
    owner: "Daniel Moreno"
    location: "..."
    
    cropAreas/
      {areaId}/
        name: "Greenhouse 1"
        type: "greenhouse"
        
        sections/
          {sectionId}/
            name: "Section A"
            
            beds/
              {bedId}/
                bedNumber: "A1"
                status: "harvesting"
                statusHistory: [...]
                varieties: [...]
                harvestReports: [...]
                
    harvestReports/
      {reportId}/
        bedId: "..."
        date: timestamp
        reportedBy: "Worker Name"
        quantity: 5.5
        unit: "kilograms"
        
    completedBeds/
      {completedBedId}/
        originalBedId: "..."
        bedSnapshot: {...}
        totalHarvested: 142.5
        seasonYear: 2025
        
    tasks/
      {taskId}/
        bedId: "..."
        title: "Water plants"
        dueDate: timestamp

users/
  {userId}/
    displayName: "..."
    role: "worker"
```

## 🎨 UI Components You Can Build

### Bed Card Component
Shows bed status, varieties, harvest info at a glance

### Bed Detail View
- Status timeline
- Plant varieties
- Harvest history
- Quick actions (change status, report harvest, add notes)

### Harvest Report Form
- Worker name
- Quantity & unit
- Quality rating
- Notes
- Variety selection

### Section View
- Grid of beds
- Color-coded by status
- Quick status overview

### Analytics Dashboard
- Total harvest per area
- Harvest by worker
- Yield trends
- Year-over-year comparison

---

## 🤖 MCP-Ready Structure

The data structure is optimized for LLM integration:

### Natural Language Queries Supported

```
"How much did we harvest from Greenhouse 1 last month?"
"Which beds are ready to harvest this week?"
"What's the average yield per bed for cherry tomatoes?"
"Show me beds that have been growing for over 60 days"
"Which worker harvested the most last week?"
"Compare this year's tomato yield to last year"
```

### Why It Works

1. **Clear Hierarchy** - LLM understands farm → area → section → bed
2. **Rich Timestamps** - Every change is tracked with date
3. **Denormalized Data** - Bed contains cropAreaId for easy querying
4. **Descriptive Names** - `expectedHarvestStart` vs `harvestDate`
5. **Status History** - Complete lifecycle tracking
6. **Separate Collections** - Easy to query harvest reports independently

---

## 📊 Sample Workflow

### Complete Bed Lifecycle Example

```
1. Create Farm & Crop Area
   Farm: "Sunrise Farm"
   Area: "Greenhouse 1" (type: greenhouse)
   
2. Create Section
   Section: "Section A"
   
3. Create Bed
   Bed: "A1"
   Status: Dirty
   
4. Clean & Prepare
   Status: Dirty → Clean (worker: John, date: Jan 1)
   Status: Clean → Prepared (worker: John, date: Jan 2)
   
5. Plant
   Method: Transplanted
   Variety: Cherry Tomatoes (24 plants, 65 days to maturity)
   Date Planted: Jan 5
   Expected Harvest: Mar 10
   Status: Prepared → Planted → Growing
   
6. Harvest Period (Multiple)
   Mar 10: 5kg (Excellent) - Maria
   Mar 12: 4.5kg (Good) - John
   Mar 15: 6kg (Excellent) - Maria
   ... (continues for weeks)
   Status: Growing → Harvesting
   
7. Complete
   Total: 142kg over 47 reports
   Duration: 122 days
   Avg: 1.16 kg/day
   Status: Harvesting → Completed
   
8. Archive
   → Moves to CompletedBeds
   → Original bed deleted
   → Can create new bed "A1" starting at Dirty
```
